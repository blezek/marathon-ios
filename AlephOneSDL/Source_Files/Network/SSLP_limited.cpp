 *  This version does things the easy way, which should support current Aleph One needs, but which means
 *	there are several limitations.
 *  This version is built on top of SDL_net and my so-called "SDL_netx", broadcast extensions to SDL_net.
 *  This version is designed to receive processing time from the application's main thread by the
 *      main thread calling SSLP_Pump().  This way, there are no threading issues to worry about.  Of
 *      course, proper operation depends on receiving the processor from time to time while a lookup or
 *      discovery-allowance is in effect.

 *  Created by Woody Zenfell, III on Mon Oct 1 2001, from SSLP_limited_threaded.cpp.

 June 15, 2002 (Loren Petrich):
 	Added packing and unpacking, so as to avoid compiler dependency
        
 Jan 18, 2003 (Woody Zenfell):
        Using A1's Logging system instead of older diagnostic-message schemes
