	Rendering Object-Placement Class
	by Loren Petrich,
	August 6, 2000
	
	Defines a class for placing inhabitants in appropriate rendering order; from render.c
	Works from RenderSortPoly stuff.
	
	Made [view_data *view] a member and removed it as an argument
	
Oct 13, 2000
	LP: replaced GrowableLists and ResizableLists with STL vectors
